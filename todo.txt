- cmdserver
  - spawn cmdprocs and send them sockets to listen to 
    messages on, and register their names with the sockets

- voiceserver
  - DFA for cmd server + cmd proc for taking 'cmd's and passing to 
    command server
  - pass cmd if falls within constraints (duplicates, etc., check output)

  - generate command corpa

  - make gui prompts work
  - add autocomplete to them
  - current application context in cmdserver
  - add commands:
    - pidgin
      - MESSAGE arg: send message to online user (autocomplete user name), or currently active conversation, whatever's easiest
    - clementine
      - TRACK arg: play title track
      - make autocomplete for cmdproc commands
      - record track commands in macro
      - add UNDO commmand when recording macros
        - make cmdproc's respond to UNDO
      - add notifications:
        - on macro RECORD
        - on command recorded 
        - on command undone 
        - on macro FINISH
        - on anything that isn't obvious that it got performed
  - in pidgin, if last sender is None, ignore command
  - notifications to user about
    - current receiving application (from SEND)
    - failed commands? (it not doing what you told it is good enough?)

cassey
- add "WAKE UP CALM" to start having calm listen (reduce false activation) 
- voice for program names (music, messenger, window)
- "TALK TO <program>" to have multiple commands direct to a program and "END" to stop
- add "GO TO SLEEP" to stop CALM from listening

- Use a word other than "TALK" to start talking to a program (keeps getting mixed up with TOP).
  - or just hack it...yeah!


- fix input box
- not so huge
- clickable?

- add a "HELP" or "HELP CALM" command for displaying help about the currently available commands (i.e. if 
  we are currently talking to a program [we are sending to one or talking to one], or if we are using the 
  active application, or any server commands [if we are not sending to one?])
  - should also help with the case of "what program am I talking to / who am I sending commands?"
- make notifications get sent to the server so they update properly
